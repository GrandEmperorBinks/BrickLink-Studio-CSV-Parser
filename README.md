Bricklink is an international marketplace website for Lego sets, pieces, minifigures, and more.  
Studio, or Bricklink Studio, is a digital Lego building software created and maintained by Bricklink, with a certain amount of integration into Bricklink present.  
  
Studio allows for the exportation of models as a CSV file, storing information on each piece.  
Bricklink allows for the uploading of CSV files into wishlists.  
  
The aim of this project is to create a program that can parse 2 CSV files, automatically comparing them and performing a pre-specified action on them, then saving the result as a third CSV file.
